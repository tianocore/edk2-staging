NOTE: All statements regarding implementation specific details of **toro C Library** are always strictly focused on
my observations of Microsoft C Library, running "C" locale, at UTC timezone. Referring to Standard/ANSI C might be a 
Microsoft specific implementation of the specification, but I always give my best to double-check the statements on GCC x64. In critical cases
also old Borland, Watcom and Digital Mars C compiler and library were queried. **toro C Library** is engineered -- not "scientifized".
This is also true for all upcoming CdePkgBlogs.
